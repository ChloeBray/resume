I'm an editor with experience editing non-fiction and fiction, including academic work and children's fiction. I currently copyedit academic articles for an open-access journal publisher. I hold a BA from the University of Toronto, an MA from Sciences Po Paris, and a Certificate in Publishing from Ryerson University.

As an avid reader, I love helping clients make their writing the best that it can be. Though I am a proficient copyeditor, my passions are line and substantive editing. I work closely with clients to polish their work so that it shines. I approach every piece as an opportunity to preserve the essence of the writer's voice while ensuring that the writing is clear, effective, and engaging.

Whether you're looking for a copyeditor for a short article, a substantive editor for flash fiction, an unbiased first reader, or anything in between, I can help!
